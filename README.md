## Description

The aim of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing model for an API that categorises disaster messages. 

This project fulfills the reuqirements for the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Appen. 

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

### Installing
Clone this GIT repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bethbarlow7/udacity_ds_nanodegree_disaster_response
```
<a name="executing"></a>
### Executing Program:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
